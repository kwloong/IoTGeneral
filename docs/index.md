# Introduction

General Tidbits on Internet of Things (IoT), the broad topic of making useful services and things out of connecting sensors, actuators, etc. to the Internet.

The current impetus for doing this repo is to gradually update and sort out collated stuff of different interesting tidbits about IoT collected over the years, for easy, simple private sharing with friends.

With time scrimped and saved from real life :)
